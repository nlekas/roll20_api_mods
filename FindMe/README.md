# Find Me
This script solves the problem of Roll20 opening the 
map haphazardly. This causes players to have to search the map for 
the tokens your players control. 

To use the script, type !findMe. A list of tokens you control will appear in
the chat. Click on that token and your screen will be moved to 
that location.

This is an improvement on another script (see below). The improvement
accounts for tokens that are controlled my multiple players. This is 
useful if you are using Roll20 in an in-person session and 
all characters are controlled by a dummy account. But you also have
characters assigned to players because you also play online.
